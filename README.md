WatchKitCounter2WayComm
===================
Demo of 2 way communication between an Apple Watch app and it's parent iOS app. Information can be passed to the iOS app, which then "replies" back with a response to the watch extension and updates the UI for the watch app. This is an add-on to my original [Send Data to Parent iOS App tutorial](http://www.kristinathai.com/send-data-to-parent-ios-app/).
